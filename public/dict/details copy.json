This process imparts an incredibly rich flavour into the rice; it is said that in Singaporean chicken rice, the rice is arguably more important than the chicken itself.^{1}<br>Apart from the Hainanese \"white\" chicken, most stalls offer roast chicken and sometimes others variations like lemon chicken as alternative choices.<br>The dish is usually served with the chicken sliced and either laid over a bowl's worth of the rice, or on a separate dish; the chicken pieces are drenched in a dressing of light soya sauce, chicken oil, and sesame oil. It is served with a bowl of the leftover stock, garnished with chopped spring onions.<br>Singaporeans prefer to eat chicken rice with either a special chilli, sweet dark soya sauce, or ginger-garlic sauce. So crucial is the chilli that sometimes people judge chicken rice based on the taste of the chilli alone.<br>It is arguably the most famous dish of Singapore.

While it may not have originated in Mandarin, one of its earliest attestations in Chinese literature is in Shi Nai An's 14th-century classic <i>Water Margin</i>, one of the first novels ever to be written in vernacular Mandarin.^{1}<br>泰山 (Taishan) is a sacred mountain in Shandong, China, which has great religious and cultural significance. Its Jade Emperor Peak is the highest point in Shandong at 1545 m.^{2}<br>The idiom may be simply interpreted as that someone has to be truly blind to miss or fail to recognize the majesty of the sacred mountain and its breathtaking landscape, especially when it is right in front of their eyes.<br>However, the true origin of the phrase is most commonly held to refer to the story of Taishan (also 泰山), a bamboo craftsman. Taishan travelled thousands of miles from his home in South China to study as an apprentice under the master carpenter Lu Ban. Lu Ban had very high standards, and few apprentices passed his assessments - least of all Taishan, who had very little proper experience with woodworking before arriving - leading to his unceremonious elimination from the apprenticeship.<br>Many years later, Lu Ban was travelling the South when he chanced upon the most exquisite and beautiful bamboo tools he had seen in his life. When he inquired with the townsfolk at the bazaar, he eventually learned that the craftsman was Taishan, the apprentice he had rejected all those years ago. He was then filled with deep remorse and emotion at his mistake, admitting that \"at the time, he really didn't know Taishan\".^{3}^{4}^{5}","references":[{"link":"https://web.archive.org/web/20211019172129/http://www.lunwenstudy.com/gudaiwx/45439.html","name":"温庆新 (2014). \"关于《水浒传》成书时间研究的方法论思考\". 清华大学学报哲学社会科学版.

Within each suit, 2 is the highest card (hence the name of the game in English, \"Big Two\"), followed by the ace, then the cards in usual order. However, the ace and 2 may play the roles of the values 1 and 2 in certain situations, such as in a straight.<br>To start, each player is dealt a hand made by dealing all the cards until the remainder is no longer divisible by the number of players. If there are any leftover cards, the players with the lowest-ranked cards (3 of diamonds, then 3 of clubs, etc.) take a corresponding card from the remainder, to give them an advantage in forming combinations.<br>The player with the 3 of diamonds goes first, discarding the three of diamonds in some combination of 1, 2, or 5 cards. All players then have to make a play of higher value by discarding the same number of cards as the round started with in turn (with some rare exceptions, such as when a player has a \"dragon\" straight), or skip their turn if they are unable or unwilling to do so. Once play has gone a full round without anyone matching a player's play, they win that round and get to start a new round with any combination they please.
