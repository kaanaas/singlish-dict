This process imparts an incredibly rich flavour into the rice; it is said that in Singaporean chicken rice, the rice is arguably more important than the chicken itself.^{1}<br>Apart from the Hainanese \"white\" chicken, most stalls offer roast chicken and sometimes others variations like lemon chicken as alternative choices.<br>The dish is usually served with the chicken sliced and either laid over a bowl's worth of the rice, or on a separate dish; the chicken pieces are drenched in a dressing of light soya sauce, chicken oil, and sesame oil. It is served with a bowl of the leftover stock, garnished with chopped spring onions.<br>Singaporeans prefer to eat chicken rice with either a special chilli, sweet dark soya sauce, or ginger-garlic sauce. So crucial is the chilli that sometimes people judge chicken rice based on the taste of the chilli alone.<br>It is arguably the most famous dish of Singapore.
