Thus, Ang Mo Kio probably referred to a nearly iron – hence, modern – bridge built to replace an old wooden one.","exampleSource":"2006 March 17, Chew Poh Loh. <i>Today (from Todayonline.com)</i>.","synonyms":["kentang"],"antonyms":false}]},"particles":[]},"ang moh chu":{"word":"ang moh chu","sense":0,"related":["ang moh","bungalow"],"usage":"","category":[],"phonetics":"","etyNotes":"","origin":[{"lang":"hokkien","traditional":"紅毛厝","simplified":"红毛厝","roman":"âng-mô͘-chhù","romanization":"poj","lit":"Western-style building; (lit.) white man's / Caucasian house","etyPath":false,"etyType":false,"etyScript":false,"etyTrad":false,"etyRoman":false,"etyScheme":false,"etyLit":false}],"meanings":{"noun":[{"definition":"a Western-style building, especially from the colonial era, such as a bungalow or a black-and-white house.","example":"These black and white Anglo-Indian bungalows (which come from the term Bangala or Bengali for from Bengal) or “Ang-Moh Chu” (White Man’s House) are designed in the “revival architectural style”.<br>It’s not just a residential estate.
