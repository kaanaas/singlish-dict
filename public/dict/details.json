It is served with a bowl of the leftover stock, garnished with chopped spring onions.<br>Singaporeans prefer to eat chicken rice with either a special chilli, sweet dark soya sauce, or ginger-garlic sauce.

Within each suit, 2 is the highest card (hence the name of the game in English, \"Big Two\"), followed by the ace, then the cards in usual order. However, the ace and 2 may play the roles of the values 1 and 2 in certain situations, such as in a straight.<br>To start, each player is dealt a hand made by dealing all the cards until the remainder is no longer divisible by the number of players. If there are any leftover cards, the players with the lowest-ranked cards (3 of diamonds, then 3 of clubs, etc.) take a corresponding card from the remainder, to give them an advantage in forming combinations.<br>The player with the 3 of diamonds goes first, discarding the three of diamonds in some combination of 1, 2, or 5 cards. All players then have to make a play of higher value by discarding the same number of cards as the round started with in turn (with some rare exceptions, such as when a player has a \"dragon\" straight), or skip their turn if they are unable or unwilling to do so. Once play has gone a full round without anyone matching a player's play, they win that round and get to start a new round with any combination they please. The game may end when one player has discarded all their cards, or keep going until there is one loser left.<br>While the game is popular throughout East and South-East Asia and within the diasporas of these regions, it originated somewhere in China, likely in Hong Kong."}]},"related":["asshole dai di"],"category":["games"]},"damn":{"word":"damn","origin":[{"etyPath":["english","old french","latin"],"etyRoman":["damn","damner","damnāre"],"etyLit":["condemn; (vulgar) bloody; exp. of annoyance, frustration, irritation, etc.","to damn","condemn; cause loss to"]}],"meanings":{"adverb":[{"definition":"(slightly vulgar) extremely; very","example":[{"eg":"Finally get to sleep in... damn @{shiok}!"}],"synonyms":["si peh","very the","abit the","abit","jin"]},{"definition":"(slightly vulgar) very; placed before a noun to make a strong comparison or equivalence between it and someone or something else; adjectifier for any noun","synonyms":["so"]}]},"category":["vulgar"],"usage":"Due to how commonly and wantonly it is used, it is less vulgar than when used in English.","particles":[{"particle":"sia","meaning":"Whoa, damn!","example":"","exampleSource":"","effect":"interjectification; awe"}]},"dao":{"word":"dao","origin":[{"etyPath":["cantonese"],"etyScript":["高窦"],"etyTrad":["高竇"],"etyRoman":["gou1 dau3"],"etyLit":["arrogant; snobbish; stuck-up"]}],"etyNotes":"Clipping of the Cantonese slang term.<br>The sense of \"to ignore; to ghost\" probably evolved from the adjectival senses at some later point; compare the related term @{pai tao}, which underwent a very similar semantic shift.","meanings":{"adjective":[{"definition":"arrogant; snobbish; stuck-up; conceited","example":[{"eg":"Wah very dao ah you.

Taishan travelled thousands of miles from his home in South China to study as an apprentice under the master carpenter Lu Ban. Lu Ban had very high standards, and few apprentices passed his assessments - least of all Taishan, who had very little proper experience with woodworking before arriving - leading to his unceremonious elimination from the apprenticeship.<br>Many years later, Lu Ban was travelling the South when he chanced upon the most exquisite and beautiful bamboo tools he had seen in his life. When he inquired with the townsfolk at the bazaar, he eventually learned that the craftsman was Taishan, the apprentice he had rejected all those years ago.
