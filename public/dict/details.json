It is served with a bowl of the leftover stock, garnished with chopped spring onions.<br>Singaporeans prefer to eat chicken rice with either a special chilli, sweet dark soya sauce, or ginger-garlic sauce.

Within each suit, 2 is the highest card (hence the name of the game in English, \"Big Two\"), followed by the ace, then the cards in usual order. However, the ace and 2 may play the roles of the values 1 and 2 in certain situations, such as in a straight.<br>To start, each player is dealt a hand made by dealing all the cards until the remainder is no longer divisible by the number of players. If there are any leftover cards, the players with the lowest-ranked cards (3 of diamonds, then 3 of clubs, etc.) take a corresponding card from the remainder, to give them an advantage in forming combinations.<br>The player with the 3 of diamonds goes first, discarding the three of diamonds in some combination of 1, 2, or 5 cards. All players then have to make a play of higher value by discarding the same number of cards as the round started with in turn (with some rare exceptions, such as when a player has a \"dragon\" straight), or skip their turn if they are unable or unwilling to do so. Once play has gone a full round without anyone matching a player's play, they win that round and get to start a new round with any combination they please. The game may end when one player has discarded all their cards, or keep going until there is one loser left.<br>While the game is popular throughout East and South-East Asia and within the diasporas of these regions, it originated somewhere in China, likely in Hong Kong."}]},"related":["asshole dai di"],"category":["games"]},"damn":{"word":"damn","origin":[{"lang":"english","roman":"damn","lit":"condemn; (vulgar) bloody; exp. of annoyance, frustration, irritation, etc.","etyPath":["old french","latin"],"etyRoman":["damner","damnāre"],"etyLit":["to damn","condemn; cause loss to"]}],"meanings":{"adverb":[{"definition":"(slightly vulgar) extremely; very","example":[{"eg":"Finally get to sleep in... damn @{shiok}!"}],"synonyms":["si peh","very the","abit the","abit","jin"]},{"definition":"(slightly vulgar) very; placed before a noun to make a strong comparison or equivalence between it and someone or something else; adjectifier for any noun","synonyms":["so"]}]},"category":["vulgar"],"usage":"Due to how commonly and wantonly it is used, it is less vulgar than when used in English.","particles":[{"particle":"sia","meaning":"Whoa, damn!","example":"","exampleSource":"","effect":"interjectification; awe"}]},"dao":{"word":"dao","origin":[{"lang":"cantonese","traditional":"高竇","simplified":"高窦","roman":"gou1 dau3","lit":"arrogant; snobbish; stuck-up"}],"etyNotes":"Clipping of the Cantonese slang term.","meanings":{"adjective":[{"definition":"arrogant; snobbish; stuck-up; conceited","example":[{"eg":"Wah very dao ah you.
