The rice is fried in chicken fat, then cooked in the leftover stock from poaching the chicken, combined with spices like salt, garlic, and spring onion. This process imparts an incredibly rich flavour into the rice; it is said that in Singaporean chicken rice, the rice is arguably more important than the chicken itself.^{1}<br>Apart from the Hainanese \"white\" chicken, most stalls offer roast chicken and sometimes others variations like lemon chicken as alternative choices.<br>The dish is usually served with the chicken sliced and either laid over a bowl's worth of the rice, or on a separate dish; the chicken pieces are drenched in a dressing of light soya sauce, chicken oil, and sesame oil. It is served with a bowl of the leftover stock, garnished with chopped spring onions.<br>Singaporeans prefer to eat chicken rice with either a special chilli, sweet dark soya sauce, or ginger-garlic sauce. So crucial is the chilli that sometimes people judge chicken rice based on the taste of the chilli alone.<br>It is arguably the most famous dish of Singapore. Similar 'chicken rice' dishes also exist across the Hainanese diaspora, especially in South-East Asia, such as in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. ...<b></b>l dish of Singapore, developed by Hainanese immigrants in the early 20th century from "

The rice is fried in chicken fat, then cooked in the leftover stock from poaching the chicken, combined with spices like salt, garlic, and spring onion. This process imparts an incredibly rich flavour into the rice; it is said that in Singaporean chicken rice, the rice is arguably more important than the chicken itself.^{1}<br>Apart from the Hainanese \"white\" chicken, most stalls offer roast chicken and sometimes others variations like lemon chicken as alternative choices.<br>The dish is usually served with the chicken sliced and either laid over a bowl's worth of the rice, or on a separate dish; the chicken pieces are drenched in a dressing of light soya sauce, chicken oil, and sesame oil. It is served with a bowl of the leftover stock, garnished with chopped spring onions.<br>Singaporeans prefer to eat chicken rice with either a special chilli, sweet dark soya sauce, or ginger-garlic sauce. So crucial is the chilli that sometimes people judge chicken rice based on the taste of the chilli alone.<br>It is arguably the most famous dish of Singapore. Similar 'chicken rice' dishes also exist across the Hainanese diaspora, especially in South-East Asia, such as in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. ...<b></b>ional dish of Singapore, developed by Hainanese immigrants in the early 20th century from "

The objective of the game is to be the first to get rid of all of one's cards, by depositing sequences of poker-like hands (such as ones, twos, five-card combinations, etc.) of increasing value in turn.<br>The suits are ranked with Diamonds being the lowest, followed by Clubs, Hearts, then Spades. Within each suit, 2 is the highest card (hence the name of the game in English, \"Big Two\"), followed by the ace, then the cards in usual order. However, the ace and 2 may play the roles of the values 1 and 2 in certain situations, such as in a straight.<br>To start, each player is dealt a hand made by dealing all the cards until the remainder is no longer divisible by the number of players. If there are any leftover cards, the players with the lowest-ranked cards (3 of diamonds, then 3 of clubs, etc.) take a corresponding card from the remainder, to give them an advantage in forming combinations.<br>The player with the 3 of diamonds goes first, discarding the three of diamonds in some combination of 1, 2, or 5 cards. All players then have to make a play of higher value by discarding the same number of cards as the round started with in turn (with some rare exceptions, such as when a player has a \"dragon\" straight), or skip their turn if they are unable or unwilling to do so. Once play has gone a full round without anyone matching a player's play, they win that round and get to start a new round with any combination they please. The game may end when one player has discarded all their cards, or keep going until there is one loser left.<br>While the game is popular throughout East and South-East Asia and within the diasporas of these regions, it originated somewhere in China, likely in Hong Kong. ...<b></b>card game extremely popular in East Asia, played using a standard 52-card deck.

The objective of the game is to be the first to get rid of all of one's cards, by depositing sequences of poker-like hands (such as ones, twos, five-card combinations, etc.) of increasing value in turn.<br>The suits are ranked with Diamonds being the lowest, followed by Clubs, Hearts, then Spades. Within each suit, 2 is the highest card (hence the name of the game in English, \"Big Two\"), followed by the ace, then the cards in usual order. However, the ace and 2 may play the roles of the values 1 and 2 in certain situations, such as in a straight.<br>To start, each player is dealt a hand made by dealing all the cards until the remainder is no longer divisible by the number of players. If there are any leftover cards, the players with the lowest-ranked cards (3 of diamonds, then 3 of clubs, etc.) take a corresponding card from the remainder, to give them an advantage in forming combinations.<br>The player with the 3 of diamonds goes first, discarding the three of diamonds in some combination of 1, 2, or 5 cards. All players then have to make a play of higher value by discarding the same number of cards as the round started with in turn (with some rare exceptions, such as when a player has a \"dragon\" straight), or skip their turn if they are unable or unwilling to do so. Once play has gone a full round without anyone matching a player's play, they win that round and get to start a new round with any combination they please. The game may end when one player has discarded all their cards, or keep going until there is one loser left.<br>While the game is popular throughout East and South-East Asia and within the diasporas of these regions, it originated somewhere in China, likely in Hong Kong. ...<b></b>rd game extremely popular in East Asia, played using a standard 52-card deck.

The objective of the game is to be the first to get rid of all of one's cards, by depositing sequences of poker-like hands (such as ones, twos, five-card combinations, etc.) of increasing value in turn.<br>The suits are ranked with Diamonds being the lowest, followed by Clubs, Hearts, then Spades. Within each suit, 2 is the highest card (hence the name of the game in English, \"Big Two\"), followed by the ace, then the cards in usual order. However, the ace and 2 may play the roles of the values 1 and 2 in certain situations, such as in a straight.<br>To start, each player is dealt a hand made by dealing all the cards until the remainder is no longer divisible by the number of players. If there are any leftover cards, the players with the lowest-ranked cards (3 of diamonds, then 3 of clubs, etc.) take a corresponding card from the remainder, to give them an advantage in forming combinations.<br>The player with the 3 of diamonds goes first, discarding the three of diamonds in some combination of 1, 2, or 5 cards. All players then have to make a play of higher value by discarding the same number of cards as the round started with in turn (with some rare exceptions, such as when a player has a \"dragon\" straight), or skip their turn if they are unable or unwilling to do so. Once play has gone a full round without anyone matching a player's play, they win that round and get to start a new round with any combination they please. The game may end when one player has discarded all their cards, or keep going until there is one loser left.<br>While the game is popular throughout East and South-East Asia and within the diasporas of these regions, it originated somewhere in China, likely in Hong Kong. ...<b></b> game extremely popular in East Asia, played using a standard 52-card deck.

            "a national dish of Singapore, developed by Hainanese immigrants in the early 20th century from a traditional Hainanese dish called Wenchang chicken, which is the predecessor of today's \"white\" chicken rice. The rice is fried in chicken fat, then cooked in the leftover stock from poaching the chicken, combined with spices like salt, garlic, and spring onion. This process imparts an incredibly rich flavour into the rice; it is said that in Singaporean chicken rice, the rice is arguably more important than the chicken itself.^{1}<br>Apart from the Hainanese \"white\" chicken, most stalls offer roast chicken and sometimes others variations like lemon chicken as alternative choices.<br>The dish is usually served with the chicken sliced and either laid over a bowl's worth of the rice, or on a separate dish; the chicken pieces are drenched in a dressing of light soya sauce, chicken oil, and sesame oil. It is served with a bowl of the leftover stock, garnished with chopped spring onions.<br>Singaporeans prefer to eat chicken rice with either a special chilli, sweet dark soya sauce, or ginger-garlic sauce. So crucial is the chilli that sometimes people judge chicken rice based on the taste of the chilli alone.<br>It is arguably the most famous dish of Singapore. Similar 'chicken rice' dishes also exist across the Hainanese diaspora, especially in South-East Asia, such as in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. ...<b></b>nal dish of Singapore, developed by Hainanese immigrants in the early 20th century from "

            "a card game extremely popular in East Asia, played using a standard 52-card deck. In Singapore, the game typically may be played between 2-5 players, but the optimal number is four. The objective of the game is to be the first to get rid of all of one's cards, by depositing sequences of poker-like hands (such as ones, twos, five-card combinations, etc.) of increasing value in turn.<br>The suits are ranked with Diamonds being the lowest, followed by Clubs, Hearts, then Spades. Within each suit, 2 is the highest card (hence the name of the game in English, \"Big Two\"), followed by the ace, then the cards in usual order. However, the ace and 2 may play the roles of the values 1 and 2 in certain situations, such as in a straight.<br>To start, each player is dealt a hand made by dealing all the cards until the remainder is no longer divisible by the number of players. If there are any leftover cards, the players with the lowest-ranked cards (3 of diamonds, then 3 of clubs, etc.) take a corresponding card from the remainder, to give them an advantage in forming combinations.<br>The player with the 3 of diamonds goes first, discarding the three of diamonds in some combination of 1, 2, or 5 cards. All players then have to make a play of higher value by discarding the same number of cards as the round started with in turn (with some rare exceptions, such as when a player has a \"dragon\" straight), or skip their turn if they are unable or unwilling to do so. Once play has gone a full round without anyone matching a player's play, they win that round and get to start a new round with any combination they please. The game may end when one player has discarded all their cards, or keep going until there is one loser left.<br>While the game is popular throughout East and South-East Asia and within the diasporas of these regions, it originated somewhere in China, likely in Hong Kong. ...<b></b>ard game extremely popular in East Asia, played using a standard 52-card deck.

Within each suit, 2 is the highest card (hence the name of the game in English, \"Big Two\"), followed by the ace, then the cards in usual order. However, the ace and 2 may play the roles of the values 1 and 2 in certain situations, such as in a straight.<br>To start, each player is dealt a hand made by dealing all the cards until the remainder is no longer divisible by the number of players. If there are any leftover cards, the players with the lowest-ranked cards (3 of diamonds, then 3 of clubs, etc.) take a corresponding card from the remainder, to give them an advantage in forming combinations.<br>The player with the 3 of diamonds goes first, discarding the three of diamonds in some combination of 1, 2, or 5 cards. All players then have to make a play of higher value by discarding the same number of cards as the round started with in turn (with some rare exceptions, such as when a player has a \"dragon\" straight), or skip their turn if they are unable or unwilling to do so. Once play has gone a full round without anyone matching a player's play, they win that round and get to start a new round with any combination they please. The game may end when one player has discarded all their cards, or keep going until there is one loser left.<br>While the game is popular throughout East and South-East Asia and within the diasporas of these regions, it originated somewhere in China, likely in Hong Kong. ...<b></b> game extremely popular in East Asia, played using a standard 52-card deck.
